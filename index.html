    <h2>The story</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">“We
      are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q>
      The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</q></em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven
      wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh,
      isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
      The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em> “Maybe.”</em></q> The following day his son tried to break
      one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
      The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,”</q> and the farmer
      responded,<em> <q class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to
      conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
      broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">“Isn’t that
      great!”</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q> The whole process of nature is an
      integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
      tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you
      never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
      know what will be the consequences of<em class="good">good</em>fortune.
