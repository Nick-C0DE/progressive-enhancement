    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
      are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
      The farmer said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven
      wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh,
      isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
      The farmer again said,<em> “Maybe.”</em> The following day his son tried to break
      one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
      The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,” and the farmer
      responded,<em> “Maybe.” </em>The next day the conscription officers came around to
      conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
      broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that
      great!” Again, he said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> The whole process of nature is an
      integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
      tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you
      never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
      know what will be the consequences of<em class="good">good</em>fortune.
